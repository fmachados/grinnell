\usage{

                     covariance_matrix = NULL, variables,
                     suitability_threshold = 5, tolerance = 1e-60)
}
\arguments{
\item{ellipsoid_model}{object produced with the function
\code{ellipsoid_suitability}. If defined, arguments \code{centroid} and
\code{covariance_matrix} are not used. Default = NULL. This argument can be
overlooked if \code{centroid} and \code{covariance_matrix} are defined.}

\item{centroid}{centroid from which distances are measured in \code{variables}.
The length and variables of centroid must correspond with those of layers in
\code{variables}. Ignored if \code{ellipsoid_model} is defined. Default = NULL.}

\item{covariance_matrix}{covariance matrix to be used when measuring the
Mahalanobis distances. Ignored if \code{ellipsoid_model} is defined.
Default = NULL.}

\item{variables}{a SpatRaster of variables representing the environmental
conditions in the area where the model will be transferred to.}

\item{suitability_threshold}{(numeric) value (percentage) to be used as
threshold; default = 5.}

\item{tolerance}{the tolerance for detecting linear dependencies.
Default = 1e-60.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item niche centroid
\item covariance matrix
\item proportion of suitable areas in environmental and geographic space
\item suitability SpatRaster
}

\description{
predict_esuitability predicts a SpatRaster of environmental
suitability based on Mahalanobis distances to a niche centroid and a
covariance matrix.
