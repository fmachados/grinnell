principal component analyses.}

\item{center}{(logical) whether or not to center variables while performing
principal component analyses.}

\item{project}{(logical) whether or not to project environmental suitability
to past scenarios. The projection is done to the scenario defined by
\code{projection_variables} and to any other scenario resulting from
interpolations between current and past conditions. If TRUE,
arguments \code{projection_variables}, \code{simulation_period},

scenario. Default = 25.}

\item{write_all_scenarios}{(logical) whether or not to write results
for all scenarios. The default, FALSE, writes only the final results.}

\item{output_directory}{(character) name of the output directory to be created
in which all results will be written.}

\item{overwrite}{(logical) whether or not to overwrite the
\code{output_directory} if it already exists. Default = FALSE.}

\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item occurrences found in suitable areas in the scenario where the simulation
started.
\item all and ordered scenarios considered for the simulation
\item a list with the parameters used during the simulation
\item accessible areas as a SpatRaster (value 1 = accessed)
\item accessible areas as a SpatVector object (only accessed areas)
\item a SpatRaster representing mean values of accessibility frequency among
replicates
\item a SpatRaster representing variance among values of accessibility frequency
of all replicates
\item if defined, the SpatRaster used in \code{barriers}, else NULL
}

The complete set of results derived from data preparation and the simulation
is written in \code{output_directory}. These results include the ones
mentioned above (except barriers), plus:
\itemize{
\item a folder containing results from the PCA performed
\item a folder containing results from the preparation of suitability layer(s)
\item other raster layers representing statistics of accessibility:
mean and variance
\item a plot representing the accessible areas and the occurrences
\item a simple report from the simulation process

\description{
M_simulationR generates an area that has been potentially
accessible to a species based on simulations of dispersal events determined
by environmental suitability and user-defined parameters.
}
\details{
A principal component analysis is performed with \code{current_variables}.
Then the three first principal components are used to calculate the
suitability layer used in dispersal simulations. Values of suitability are
derived from an ellipsoid envelope model created based on occurrence records
and principal components. The ellipsoid model is used because it is a simple
yet reliable representation of a species ecological niche that does not
require a background or pseudo-absences.

If \code{barriers} are used, suitability values in the areas where barriers
exist become zero. This is, populations cannot establish there and dispersal
will be truncated unless dispersal abilities defined by arguments
\code{dispersal_kernel} and \code{kernel_spread}, allow the species to
overpass the barriers.

If \code{project} = TRUE, the simulation will run on a set of scenarios
representing glacial-interglacial climate conditions. This set of scenarios
are constructed based on interpolations between environmental conditions in
\code{current_variables} and \code{projection_variables}. The later set of
variables must represent Last Glacial Maximum conditions. Interpolations
are linear and depend on the distance between the two initial set of
conditions and other parameter defined in \code{simulation_period},
\code{stable_current}, \code{stable_lgm}, \code{transition_to_lgm},
\code{lgm_to_current}, and \code{scenario_span}.
